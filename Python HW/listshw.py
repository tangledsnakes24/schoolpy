""" Problem 1: Sum Evens and Odds
Write a function sum_evens_odds(l) that returns a list with two elements.

    - The first element should contain the sum of all odd elements of l
    - The second element should contain the sum of all even elements of l.

You may assume that all elements of l will be positive integers.
